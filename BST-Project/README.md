# BST-Project-

The BST Visualization Project provides an interactive tool for visualizing Binary Search Trees (BSTs). This project allows users to create, modify, and explore BSTs through a dynamic graphical interface. By leveraging this tool, users can gain a deeper understanding of BST operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Features
Interactive Visualization: See real-time updates as you insert or delete nodes.
Traversal Algorithms: Visualize various tree traversal methods including Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder.
Node Operations: Add, remove, and search for nodes with immediate visual feedback.
Customizable Settings: Adjust node colors, tree layout, and other visual settings for better clarity.
Educational Resources: Access explanations and visual aids to help understand BST concepts and algorithms.
